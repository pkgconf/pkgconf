## Authorship, provenance and automated tooling

Contributions to pkgconf must have clear and defensible provenance.

By submitting a patch, you affirm that:

* You are the author of the contribution, or are authorized to
  contribute it.

* You understand the contribution in detail.

* You can explain and defend its design decisions.

* You can account for how the contribution was produced.

Submitting contributions that you do not understand, cannot explain
or cannot clearly attribute may be treated as harrassment per the
pkgconf [Code of Conduct][coc].

Contributions produced primarily by autonomous or agentic systems
are not permitted.

If tools are used during the development of a contribution, the
contributor remains responsible for the final work.  The submitted
contribution must reflect deliberate human authorship and the
contributor must be able to clearly describe its origin.

Maintainers may request clarification regarding reasoning or
provenance of any contribution.  If a contributor is unable to
demonstrate understanding or account for how a contribution was
produced, the contribution may be rejected.
